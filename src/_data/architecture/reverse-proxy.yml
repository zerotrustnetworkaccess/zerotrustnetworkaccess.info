paragraphs: 
  - text: "Agent-based architecture. Vendor's network acts as the default route for all devices. All traffic is routed via the vendor's network."
  - text: "Reverse Proxy application connects out to vendor's network, opening a reverse proxy data channel. Any other traffic entering the vendors network can then be routed to the connected device."
  - text: "End-user access may be agentless. Vendors commonly also provide Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB) and Secure Web Gateway (SWG) functions complimentary to ZTNA."
