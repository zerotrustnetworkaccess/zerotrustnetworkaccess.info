paragraphs: 
  - text: "Agent or remote-management based architecture. Vendor manages host-based firewalls built into device operating systems to control access. Centralised policy-based controller coordinates updates to each firewall."
  - text: "Products often require different areas of the network be connected and routable for any kind of traffic, and ACLs are enforced by host-based firewalls instead of perimeter devices to micro-segment networks which might otherwise be flat."
  - text: ""

strengths:
  - title: "No appliances to deploy"
    description: ""
  - title: "Universal protocol support"
    description: ""
  - title: "North-South traffic"
    description: "Traffic crossing the network perimeter, originating from outside the network, addressed to private systems within the network. Often resembles client-to-server connectivity. This architecture is agnostic to traffic pattern provided the endpoints are able to route packets to each another"
  - title: "East-West traffic"
    description: "Internal network traffic, originating inside the network perimeter and addressed to other private systems within the network. Often resembles server-to-server, machine-to-machine, inter-region connectivity or traffic inside a service mesh or service cluster. This architecture is agnostic to traffic pattern provided the endpoints are able to route packets to each another"
  - title: "Resilient to temporary trust broker failures"
    description: "Policy is cached by endpoints should trust broker become temporarily unavailable"

weaknesses:
  - title: "Primarily agent-based deployment"
    description: ""
  - title: "Non-manageable devices not serviced"
    description: "Can't be applied to scenarios where the host-based firewall may be inaccessible to the vendor (e.g. peripheral devices)"
  - title: "Assumes network reachability"
    description: "Assumes private routing is possible via appropriate WAN and VPN transports"
  - title: "Inconsistent per-OS firewall capabilities"
    description: "Not all host-based firewalls have the same capabilities"
  - title: "Legacy systems may not be manageable"
    description: "Older operating systems without host-based firewalls may not be manageable"

tradeoffs:
  - title: "Trust broker becomes the new target"
    description: "In order for endpoints to connect, the trust broker must be accessible on the network"
  - title: "Network can remain fundamentally flat"
    description: ""
  - title: "Built on IP addresses and ACLs"
    description: "Depending on the maturity of the tooling, debugging connectivity problems can be challenging in larger, multi-site deployments based on IP addresses"
