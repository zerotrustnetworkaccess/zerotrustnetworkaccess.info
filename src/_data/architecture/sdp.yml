paragraphs:
  - text: "Appliance and proxy-based architecture. A reverse proxy appliance (the SDP connector) is deployed at the network edge and governed by a centralised policy-based controller."
  - text: "Usually based on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_knocking\">Single Packet Authorization</a> (SPA). Often agentless for the client (initiating host). May not require a separate SDP connector appliance if the SDP Connector software is deployed directly to the target system(s)."

  - title: "North-South traffic"
    description: "Traffic crossing the network perimeter, originating from outside the network, addressed to private systems within the network. Often resembles client-to-server connectivity"

  - title: "Connector availability determines uptime"
    description: ""
  - title: "East-West traffic"
    description: "Internal network traffic, originating inside the network perimeter and addressed to other private systems within the network. Often resembles server-to-server, machine-to-machine, inter-region connectivity or traffic inside a service mesh or service cluster"
  - title: "Lacks universal protocol support"
    description: ""
  - title: "Must be reconfigured if network changes"
    description: ""
  - title: "High availability requires multiple appliances"
    description: ""

tradeoffs:
