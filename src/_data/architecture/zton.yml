paragraphs:
  - text: "Agent based architecture. Devices talk directly to one another coordinated by centralised policy-based management."
  - text: "Direct connections between cooperating systems are established using outbound-only traffic and a combination of device and user identity, UDP & TCP hole punching and NAT traversal techniques together create fast, end-to-end encrypted tunnels between connected systems from behind closed firewalls."
  - text: "Some NAT configurations prevent the direct connection establishment, in such cases traffic relays are used to ensure a connection can be made."

strengths:
  - title: "No ingress traffic, firewalls can be closed"
    description: ""
  - title: "No gateway devices or proxy servers"
    description: ""
  - title: "Universal protocol support"
    description: ""
  - title: "Incremental deployment"
    description: ""
  - title: "North-South traffic"
    description: "Traffic crossing the network perimeter, originating from outside the network, addressed to private systems within the network. Often resembles client-to-server connectivity. This architecture is agnostic to system location, heterogeneous provider networks and logical network boundaries"
  - title: "East-West traffic"
    description: "Internal network traffic, originating inside the network perimeter and addressed to other private systems within the network. Often resembles server-to-server, machine-to-machine, inter-region connectivity or traffic inside a service mesh or service cluster. This architecture is agnostic to system location, heterogeneous provider networks and logical network boundaries"
  - title: "Removes complexity from the network"
    description: "Overlay networks are often formed using egress-only traffic, so administrators don't need to change the underlying network in order to arrange connectivity"
  - title: "Resilient to temporary trust broker failures"
    description: "Policy is cached by endpoints should trust broker become temporarily unavailable"
  - title: "No network changes to deploy"
    description: "Deploys on existing systems"

weaknesses:
  - title: "Primarily agent-based deployment"
    description: ""
  - title: "Agent software requires patching"
    description: ""
  - title: "Trust properties not applied to peripherals"
    description: "If the agent software is not installed, Zero Trust Network Access principles are lost as traffic leaves the overlay network"
  - title: "Not protocol aware"
    description: "As of May 2022, most implementations of this architecture are not yet protocol aware"

tradeoffs:
  - title: "Trust broker becomes the new target"
    description: "In order for endpoints to connect, the trust broker must be publicly accessible"
  - title: "Replaces multiple (separate) layers of protection"
