paragraphs: 
  - text: "Agent-based architecture. Vendor's product centrally manages credentials for access to target servers."
  - text: "Long-lived end-user credentials are authorized and authenticated before being transparently swapped out for unique, often single-use or limit-limited credentials which grant temporary access to target servers. Some vendors may offer protocol aware features like session recording and playback."
  - text: "Products often assume different all areas of the network be connected and routable such that clients have a network pathway available to reach target servers."
 
strengths:
  - title: "Protocol aware"
    description: "Access to application traffic"
  - title: "Session recording and playback"
    description: "Products are often able to record and playback sessions for some protocols such as SSH, RDP and database traffic"
  - title: "Credentials never exposed to end-user"
    description: "End-users are given temporary credentials for access, safeguarding primary credentials for the system"

weaknesses:
  - title: "Proxy servers are public on the Internet"
    description: "Some vendors may offer proxy servers to provide access to services separated from the client via the WAN. If available, proxy servers need to be publicly available so end-users may connect in order to authenticate"
  - title: "East-West traffic"
    description: "Internal network traffic, originating inside the network perimeter and addressed to other private systems within the network. Often resembles server-to-server, machine-to-machine, inter-region connectivity or traffic inside a service mesh or service cluster. Sessions lean heavily on user identity which may not be available for headless systems in East-West traffic patterns"
  - title: "Limited protocol support"
    description: "Proxy based, so offers limited protocol support and so may not be able to replace VPN"

tradeoffs:
  - title: "Trust broker becomes the new target"
    description: "In order for endpoints to connect, the trust broker must be accessible on the network"
  - title: "Assumes network reachability"
    description: "PAM solutions provide temporary credentials for service access, but often assumes a private network is already in place to provide network connectivity to target services either via the local network or WAN"
